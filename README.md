## TODOs

- [ ] categories should also have the same info as tags
- [x] Google Drive file picker/creator for database
- [x] Track how much you can spend if you don't consume all money for a particular tag
- [ ] better stylings
- [ ] refactor categories/tags popups
- [ ] Figure out how to handle payments done with credit cards
- [x] move from JSON save to a database approach
  - not really necessary though, json store should be enough

  - database path
  - session active/email
- [x] PWA
